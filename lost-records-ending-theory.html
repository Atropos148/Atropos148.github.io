                    <h1>The Abbys is lying in the Present</h1>
                    <h2>The metaknowledge</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>The developer studio Dontnod have never made a direct story sequel to any of their games.</p>
                        <p>Life is Strange 2 mentions the town the first game takes place in, but does not use the characters from LiS 1.</p>
                        <p>There is a character from Captain Spirit in Life is Strange 2, but Captain Spirit is not a LiS game, and that character is not playable.</p>
                        <p>Based on this I will assume that story of Lost Records is written as a "closed" story with no sequels planned.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>The evidence</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>The box that ends up being opened is filled by things from the Past that real Kat would have access to. We can see the box in her room on the night we try to break her out. The tone of the letter is that she was happy for the summer you all had together, but also that she wants you to go on and live your life as you want. I assume she would NOT want us to be unhappy because of her or the memories.</p>
                        <p>The letter she wrote that is inside the box is voice acted by Kat, but the short message written on the paper outside the box is not. This leads me to believe that the short message is written by the Abbys, to lure us into opening the box, because it is asking us to remember Kat.</p>
                        <p>At the start of Tape 2, Swan has articles in her room in the past that talk about a missing miner. The miner disappeared during work in the town mine, and was never seen again. Year later the mining company went bankrupt because no one wanted to work in the mine anymore. Few weeks after going bankrupt, the owner of the company went missing as well. I assume both of them were disappeared by the Abbys, same as Corey.</p>
                        <p>The lock that is on the box was in the cabin, but real Kat didn't have a chance to grab it the last time she was there. This means that Abbys had to add the lock as part of making us remember.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>The assumption</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>The main assumption I have is that the Abbys wants to trap human souls on a semi-regular basis. Every time it traps a soul it closes, but it only stays closed for a limited amount of time. Based on info we have, I am assuming trapping Corey closed it for 27 years.</p>
                        <p>Kat disappeared into the Abbys on the morning after Corey got trapped, as a payment for all of us losing the memory of the summer. The Abbys did promise we will all lose the memories, but did not promise anything about opening up again.</p>
                        <p>Because Kat disappeared in a different way to other souls that were trapped by the Abbys, I am assuming she cannot talk to us in any way. Which then means any "communication" that happened in the Present is the Abbys manipulating us into believing there is a chance to save Kat. I am assuming that people thrown into the Abbys can live on as crows, but people who make a direct deal disappear and do not become crows.</p>
                        <p>Abbys sent the package to Autumn, Abbys wrote the short message that is outside the box, Abbys put the lock on the box to make sure we remember the code. Abbys also put the camera into the box, because the camera fell into it, and added a completely fake video from "Kat" where it makes it seem like she is still alive.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>The Conclusion</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>The ending is showing us that Swan was manipulated by the Abbys into believing there is a chance to save Kat. The Abbys just wants to trap another soul, and Swan was the easiest to manipulate into jumping into the Abbys. I assume there are no other humans that have any memories of the hole currently, that is why Abbys chose to bring Swan instead of "convincing" a group of people over a longer period of time.</p>
                        <p>Real Kat would not want us to do anything with the hole. She did put together the things in the box and wrote a letter, but that was before the Abbys promised her our protection in exchange for forgetting memories of the summer. The only "character" that gets anything out of us remembering that summer is the Abbys.</p>
                        <p>The Abbys in the past actually did everything it promised to do, to make sure the girls trust it, and in return it got the souls of Corey and Kat.</p>
                        <p>The Abbys in the present is lying to make sure it can trap more souls.</p>
